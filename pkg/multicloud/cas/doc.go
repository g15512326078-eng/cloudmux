// Package cas implements a read-only (P0) cloudmux provider for H3C CAS
// (CVM/CVK) virtualization, talking to the CAS REST API under
// {AccessUrl}/cas/casrs/ with HTTP Digest authentication.
//
// This is not the H3C public/CloudOS provider (pkg/multicloud/h3c) and has
// nothing to do with the Keystone CAS SSO driver.
